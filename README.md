# ArmorChangeEvent
## (A library that adds ArmorChangeEvent)

Just threw this together today, as I needed it for my plugin, [MaskedCrates](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/15729/).
You have my permission to use it for you self, but for free to leave some credit :)

I will make it an official library that you can add to your pom.xml file in the near future.
